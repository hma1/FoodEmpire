             <h3>What is the Mid-Autumn Festival?</h3> 

              Also known as the Moon Festival and Harvest Moon Festival, the ritual is celebrated mainly in Chinese and Vietnamese communities. 
            

              While it has no fixed date on the calendar, it traditionally falls on the 15th day of the eighth month – a full moon day. This year, celebrations start on 24 September. 
              
              <h3>Where did it come from?</h3>
              
              Moon worship has always been an important part of Chinese culture, and there are a number of different myths surrounding the festival's genesis. 
              
              One story goes that Chinese emperors in the Zhou dynasty (1045-221 BC) worshipped the moon in autumn to bring a bumper harvest the following year; while another story holds that the moon goddess Chang'e overindulged on an elixir and flew to the moon with her jade rabbit companion. 
              
              The festival has been celebrated since the early Tang dynasty (618–907).One of the most common ways to celebrate is by eating mooncakes, although they typically have around 800 calories a cake.
              
              <h3>Where is it celebrated?</h3> 
              
              Celebrations for mid-autumn take place across East Asia, in countries including China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines. 
              
              However, families across the world observe the holiday by gathering for dinners. </p>
